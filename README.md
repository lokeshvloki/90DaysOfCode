## 📌 How This Works

Each day's progress will be documented in its respective folder.
Programs will include explanations, comments, and alternative approaches.
Some days will focus on DSA, while others may involve web development, ML models, or mini-projects.
I'll also share my learning experience, challenges faced, and solutions.
